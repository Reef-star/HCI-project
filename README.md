# 🍽️ CalorieMate – Calories Calculator Web App

**CalorieMate** is an interactive web and mobile-friendly prototype developed as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (CIS422)** course at **Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University**. The goal is to design an intuitive and user-centered interface that helps users track their daily calorie intake, plan meals, and manage their fitness goals with minimal friction.

This repository documents our **ongoing design and prototyping process**, including user research, UI flow, and early interactive wireframes.
